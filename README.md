# ornithopter_servo_based


A servo-based ornithopter is a type of flying robot that mimics the flapping-wing flight of birds or insects using one or more servo motors. An ornithopter is typically designed to generate lift and thrust by flapping its wings in a cyclic motion, similar to the way birds and insects fly. The use of servo motors in ornithopters allows for precise control over the wing motion and enables the robot to perform complex flight maneuvers.  In a typical servo-based ornithopter, the wings are attached to the servo motors using linkage systems that convert the rotational motion of the servos into flapping motion of the wings. The servos are controlled by a microcontroller or a remote control unit that sends signals to the servos to adjust the wing motion in real-time based on feedback from sensors or user inputs.  The design and construction of a servo-based ornithopter require a good understanding of aerodynamics, mechanics, and electronics, as well as the ability to program and control the servo motors using software. The size, weight, and power requirements of the servo motors and the wing design are critical factors that determine the flight performance and stability of the ornithopter.  Servo-based ornithopters are used in various applications, including scientific research, education, entertainment, and military surveillance. They offer a unique and exciting way to study the principles of flight and biomimicry, and to explore the possibilities of aerial robotics.

EXP-1 -->The servo motor is moving speed but with a small angle difference.


Exp-2 -->The servo motor is moving with somewhat less speed .


Exp-3 -->The servo motor is moving with less speed and less angle.


EXP-4 -->The servo motor is moving with less speed and more angle.


Exp-5 -->The servo motor is displaying the feedback.


Exp-6 -->The time taken to rotate from 0 degrees to 60 degrees is noted and the speed is increased .
